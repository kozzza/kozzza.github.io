## R'Scan Terms And Services

### Your Data Security
R'Scan does not store your credentials anywhere except for on your device. The only time your credentials leave your device are to make secure HTTP requests to the [UCR cas endpoint](https://auth.ucr.edu/cas/login). Your data is contained in the payload and sent over TLSv1.2 or greater.

### Transparency
The backend and frontend of the app are opensourced at https://github.com/kozzza/src128 and https://github.com/kozzza. All code at these repositories is up to date and uses CD to deploy the backend as soon as new code is pushed.

You can check out the API [here](https://src-128-8ilny.ondigitalocean.app/), hosted on Digital Ocean.
