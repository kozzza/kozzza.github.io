## R'Scan Privacy Policy & Terms of Service

### Your Data Security
R'Scan does not store your credentials anywhere except for on your device. The only time your credentials leave your device is to make secure HTTP requests to the [UCR cas SSO endpoint](https://auth.ucr.edu/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Finnosoftfusiongo.com%2Fsso%2Flogin%2Flogin-process-cas.php). Your data is contained in the payload and sent over TLSv1.2.

### Transparency
The backend and frontend of the app are opensourced at [src128](https://github.com/kozzza/src128) and [rscan](https://github.com/kozzza/rscan) respectively. All of the code in these repositories is up to date with the production version of the project.

You can check out the API [here](https://src-128.herokuapp.com/), hosted on Digital Ocean.

### Logging
R'Scan logs runtime errors and debug information like response payloads. However, none of these logs contain any sensitive information pertaining to the user (such as credentials).

### Agreements

You also acknowledge R'Scan is not responsible for the breach of your data or any unauthorized use of it. R'Scan takes no responsibility in the case ratelimits or restrictions are placed on your R'Web account as a reult of the automated sign in process.
